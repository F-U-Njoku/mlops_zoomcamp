# Experiment Tracking
The job of a data scientist involves a lot of experimenting in order to find the model that works best for a given problem. In the course of these experiments, there are multiple runs and a need to be methodological and automatic in keeping track of the process. Therefore, experiment tracking is the process of keeping track of all relevant information from a machine learning experiment, which includes:
- Source code
- Environments
- Data
- Model
- Parameters 
- Hyperparameters
- Metrics
- e.t.c

It is important to track experimetns for:
- Reproducability
- Organization
- Optimization

MLflow is a python library that is used for experiment tracking and it contains the following modules:
- Tracking
- Models
- Model Registry
- Projects
