# Introduction

## What is MLOps?

**Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** refers to a set of practices, tools, and frameworks aimed at streamlining and automating the lifecycle of Machine Learning (ML) modelsâ€”from development and deployment to monitoring and maintenance. The goal of MLOps is to create seamless, reproducible, and scalable processes for operationalizing ML.

## Core Components of MLOps

The key components typically involved in an MLOps workflow include:

* **Experiment Tracking:**

  * Keeping track of model experiments, hyperparameters, and outcomes.
  * Tools: MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune.

* **Model Registry:**

  * A centralized repository for storing, versioning, and managing trained ML models.

* **Pipelines:**

  * Automated workflows for data processing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
  * Tools: Kubeflow, Airflow, Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

* **Model Serving:**

  * Infrastructure and tools used to deploy ML models as services or APIs.
  * Tools: TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI, Kubernetes.

* **Model Monitoring:**

  * Continuous monitoring of deployed models for performance, drift, and accuracy.
  * Tools: Evidently AI, Grafana, Prometheus.

## MLOps Maturity Model

According to the [Microsoft MLOps maturity model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), organizations typically progress through five distinct maturity levels:

### Level 0: No MLOps

* Common for single data scientists or early Proof-of-Concept (PoC) projects.
* Workflow involves Jupyter notebooks without formal testing, tracking, or automation.
* Manual, ad-hoc processes.

### Level 1: DevOps (without MLOps)

* Traditional DevOps practices are adopted, including automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation.
* Still lacks ML-specific automation; manual ML processes remain.
* Represents the transition from PoC to initial production deployment.

### Level 2: Automated Training

* Automation is introduced specifically into the ML training process.
* Training pipelines become parameterized and repeatable.
* Experiment tracking captures model performance metrics systematically.
* Models are stored in a centralized model registry.
* Multiple models may exist concurrently in production environments.

### Level 3: Automated Model Deployment

* Deployment of ML models is fully automated.
* Incorporates A/B testing and automated decision-making to determine if a new model should replace the existing one.
* Provides full traceability from deployment back to data sources.

### Level 4: Full MLOps Automation

* Highest maturity with comprehensive automation.
* Entire ML workflow (training, deployment, monitoring, retraining) runs autonomously.
* Automated triggers detect drift or performance degradation and re-execute pipelines without human intervention.

## Conclusion

Adopting MLOps practices significantly enhances the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of ML workflows. Progressing through the maturity levels enables organizations to systematically automate and optimize their ML pipelines, ultimately improving the quality and sustainability of machine learning operations.
